## Coding Standards

### Naming convention:

- Meaningful and understandable variables name helps anyone to understand the reason of using it.

- Local variables should be named using camel case lettering starting with small letter (e.g. localData) whereas Global variables names should start with a capital letter (e.g. GlobalData). Constant names should be formed using capital letters only (e.g. CONSDATA).

- It is better to avoid the use of digits in variable names.

- The names of the function should be written in camel case starting with small letters.

- The name of the function must describe the reason of using the function clearly and briefly.

### Indentation:

- There must be a space after giving a comma between two function arguments.

- Each nested block should be properly indented and spaced.
Proper Indentation should be there at the beginning and at the end of each block in the program.

- All braces should start from a new line and the code following the end of braces also start from a new line.
