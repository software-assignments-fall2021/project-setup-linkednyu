## Instructions for Build and Test Locally
### Run the server
Make sure you clone the repo. Inside your local repo, using terminal.    
Go to back end folder

```
cd back-end 
```
Install dependencies 
```
npm install
```
Create a `.env` file with content that allow you to connect to database   
```
CONNECTION_URL = <your link here>
SECRET_TOKEN = secretkey
```
Start the server    
(there should be a browser windows shows up and tells you the server is running locally)
```
npm run devStart
```
Run the test   
(only for development purpose, this is not required for running the app)
```
npm run test
```
See test code coverage    
(only for development purpose, this is not required for running the app)
```
npm run coverage
```

### Run Front-end
( If you are inside back-end folder, make sure to go back first by typing `cd -` ) 

Go to front end folder  
```
cd front-end
```
Install dependencies
``` 
npm install
```
Run front end program
```
npm start
```
Now you should see a browser window running the app.    

**Note:** This app is designed for mobile users, adjust browser size for better experience.
